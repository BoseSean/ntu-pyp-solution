# ntu-pyp-solution

## Words before you use

This project aims to gather the solutions to all Nanyang Technological University past year exam papers. Besides solutions, I have also provided ready-to-print papers of several courses, which has gathered all the exam papers and eliminated bulky blank pages and chunky appendixes. Those files are under ```PYP_papers/All in one```. 

I am a SCSE student, so currently most parpers are for SCSE courses. I trully hope this project is not limited in SCSE. I know that NBS' regulation prohibits professors providing solutions, but pyp solutions could trully help us when we are preparing for final exams.

The only aim of this project is to gather exeryone's effort and help everyone better prepare for their final fnal exam. I personally do not get any 

Such project could never be complete with my own effort. Whether you are a pyp solver from school clubs, professors who are welling to help students with their study or someone preparing for the exam, I warmly welcome your Folk, Pull Request and Issues.
